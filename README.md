# Alpha-Zero-HoldYourHorses
An implementation of the Princeton version of Alpha Zero modified to work for the game Hold Your Horses. The artificial intelligence begins with no prior knowledge, and learns to play the game through self-play, policy evaluation, and policy improvement utilizing a neural net and a monte carlo search tree.

This engine requires Python >=3.6 with keras installed.

This work was branched from on the Stanford General Alpha Zero implementation and designed with the help of this tutorial:
